### SCoT Steps:
# STEP 1: REASONING - The function `compare` calculates the absolute difference between the game scores and the guesses. An edge case to test is when the game scores are all zeros. This will ensure the function handles zero values correctly and doesn't produce unexpected results.
# STEP 2: PLAN - Test function name: `test_all_zeros`. Scenario: Input `game` is `[0, 0, 0]` and `guess` is `[0, 0, 0]`. Expected output: `[0, 0, 0]`.
# STEP 3: CODE - Write the pytest suite.
