STEP 1: REASONING - The function `words_in_sentence` filters words based on their length being a prime number. An edge case is an empty sentence, which should return an empty string.

STEP 2: PLAN - Test function name: `test_empty_sentence`. Scenario: An empty sentence should return an empty string.

STEP 3: CODE - Write the high-quality pytest suite.

STEP 1: REASONING - The function `words_in_sentence` filters words based on their length being a prime number. We need to test a scenario where a word's length is not prime. Specifically, we want to test a word whose length is 1, as 1 is not a prime number.

STEP 2: PLAN - Test function name: `test_non_prime_length`. Scenario: Input sentence containing a word with length 1.
